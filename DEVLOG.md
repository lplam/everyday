# 12.11.2022 - Zig/Using Zig for Advent of Code

This year, I decided to use Zig to solve Advent of Code. I started learning Zig sometime ago but took a break. 

It was not something easy from the beginning, so in the first few days, I had to use either Go or TypeScript and reimplement the solution using Zig. Starting from Day 09, I became more comfortable writing Zig code.

To learn Zig, I think the best way is to refer to both of the [language references](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/) to learn the concepts and the [source code](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) to learn about the stdlib. Reading the code is still better than reading the [Standard Library Documentation](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#root).

Below are some notes about what I've learned during this session.
